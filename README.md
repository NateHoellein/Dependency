# Dependency

This was an exercise I created to show how to one might create a simple dependency manager.   

There are 4 initial commits that demonstrate the evolution of the code

1. Setup first boilerplace register/resolve structure
2. Introduce a different class type
3. Add guard conditions for missing registration
4. Add test to handle parameters
5. Add test to show dependency cycle.  (Resolution in progress)
